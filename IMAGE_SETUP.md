# Image Setup Instructions

## Adding the Journey Map Images

I've set up the application to display your Physique 57 journey map images. To complete the setup:

### 1. Replace Placeholder Images

**Tier 1 Journey Map:**
- Replace: `/public/images/tier1-journey-map.png`
- With: The "Physique 57 India: Tier 1 Lead Journey Map" image from your attachments
- This image shows the complete customer journey from lead ingestion through post-purchase engagement

**Tier 2 Timeline:**
- Replace: `/public/images/tier2-timeline.png` 
- With: The "Physique 57 India's Lead Management Timeline" image from your attachments
- This image shows the automated touchpoints from 5 minutes to quarterly re-engagement campaigns

### 2. Image Specifications

**Recommended formats:** PNG, JPG, WebP
**Recommended size:** Maximum width 1200px for optimal loading
**Alt text:** Already configured for accessibility

### 3. How Images Are Displayed

- **Tier 1:** Shows as an overview section before the detailed journey phases
- **Tier 2:** Shows as a timeline overview before the detailed nurture sequence
- **Styling:** Responsive design with rounded corners, borders, and shadows
- **Theme support:** Works in both light and dark modes

### 4. Current Implementation

The images are now integrated into:
- Tier 1 tab: Overview of high-intent lead journey
- Tier 2 tab: Timeline of nurture-intent lead management
- Both include descriptive headings and explanatory text
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes

Simply replace the placeholder files with your actual images and they'll appear in the application!
